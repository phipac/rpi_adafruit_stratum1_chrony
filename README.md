# Raspberry Pi 3B+ NTP Server - Stratum 1 (with Adafruit Ultimate GPS HAT)
A straightforward and optimized approach to achieve a cost-effective (€100) Stratum 1 NTP server, coordinated with highly precise PPS (Pulse Per Second) sourced from the GPS radio service plus NTP public servers across the internet to get the absolute time reference.

Can be prepared to be used with *off-the-grid* applications such as IoT in remote locations/air-gapped systems or WAN connected IoT ones (as presented here).

The end result with a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and an Adafruit Ultimate GPS HAT MTK3339:

This is my recipe for Raspberry Pi lite OS `Bookworm`, kernel 6.1.72-v8+.

# Setup the server

## Upgrade your system and install the required software

### For Ultimate GPS HAT from Adafruit 
> sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
> 
> sudo apt install gpsd gpsd-tools gpsd-clients pps-tools chrony setserial -y


## Disable the serial TTY (linux console) on the UART interface
> sudo systemctl disable --now serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service
> 
> sudo systemctl disable --now hciuart


## Disable the kernel support for the serial TTY
> sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt

Remove this ```console=serial0,115200``` and this ```kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200``` (if applicable) sequence(s) only and save.


## Configure the Raspberry Pi

Add this to your `/boot/config.txt` file:

```
[pi3+]
# Purposely made empty for advanced system tuning

[all]
# Uses the /dev/ttyAMA0 UART GPS instead of Bluetooth
dtoverlay=miniuart-bt

# Disables Bluetooth for better accuracy and lower interferance - optional
dtoverlay=disable-bt

# Disables Wifi for better accuracy and lower interferance - optional
dtoverlay=disable-wifi

# For Ultimate GPS HAT from Adafruit 
dtoverlay=pps-gpio,gpiopin=4

# Disables kernel power saving
nohz=off

# Disables Energy Efficient Ethernet - improves jitter and lag (~200us)
dtparam=eee=off

# Force CPU high speed clock
force_turbo=1
```

## Remove the support to receive NTP servers through DHCP
> sudo rm /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/timesyncd
> 
> sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf

Remove the references for `dhcp6.sntp-servers` and `ntp-servers`

## Disable and stop systemd-timesyncd to eliminte conflicts with chrony later on
> sudo systemctl disable --now systemd-timesyncd

## Decrease the serial latency for improved accuracy and stability
> sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/gps.rules

Add the content:

```
KERNEL=="ttyAMA0", RUN+="/bin/setserial /dev/ttyAMA0 low_latency"
```

## Force the CPU governor from boot, being always 'performance', aiming better timekeeping resolution
> sudo sed -i 's/CPU_DEFAULT_GOVERNOR="\${CPU_DEFAULT_GOVERNOR:-ondemand}"/CPU_DEFAULT_GOVERNOR="\${CPU_DEFAULT_GOVERNOR:-performance}"/; s/CPU_ONDEMAND_UP_THRESHOLD="\${CPU_ONDEMAND_UP_THRESHOLD:-50}"/CPU_ONDEMAND_UP_THRESHOLD="\${CPU_ONDEMAND_UP_THRESHOLD:-10}"/; s/CPU_ONDEMAND_DOWN_SAMPLING_FACTOR="\${CPU_ONDEMAND_DOWN_SAMPLING_FACTOR:-50}"/CPU_ONDEMAND_DOWN_SAMPLING_FACTOR="\${CPU_ONDEMAND_DOWN_SAMPLING_FACTOR:-10}"/' /etc/init.d/raspi-config

## Reboot to apply the system configurations
> sudo reboot

## Setup the GPSd daemon
> sudo nano /etc/default/gpsd

Replace all the content with - Ultimate GPS HAT from Adafruit :
```
START_DAEMON="true"
USBAUTO="false"

# Advanced Adafruit MK3339 chip tuning

> [!WARNING] 
> This is optional! Proceed with caution and at your own risk!

## Set NMEA sentences for timming only

Change the NMEA settings, sending exclusivly the timing one (`$GPRMC`), reducing the jitter on the `GPS` `refclock`:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This setting might be not fully successful due to the way gpsd MTK-3301 driver works. Your mileage may vary.

Stop the gpsd service:
> sudo service gpsd stop

Set the instruction:

```echo -e '$PMTK314,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0*29\r\n' > /dev/ttyAMA0```

Restart the gpsd service:
> sudo service gpsd start


### Revert to the default setting

Although the new setting is non-persistant, you might need to revert to the default one:
> echo -e '$PMTK314,-1*04\r\n' > /dev/ttyAMA0

> [!TIP]
> As a failsafe, you might power it off and remove the CR1220 battery for a few minutes.

## Set the MK3339 baudrate to its maximum

This reduces even further the NMEA sentences processing latency, by increasing the transmission speed.

Stop the gpsd service:
> sudo service gpsd stop

Set the baudrate to 57600 bps:
> echo -e '$PMTK251,57600*2C\r\n' > /dev/ttyAMA0

### Setup the GPSd daemon
> sudo nano /etc/default/gpsd

Replace all the content with:
```
START_DAEMON="true"
USBAUTO="false"
DEVICES="/dev/ttyAMA0 /dev/pps0″
GPSD_OPTIONS="--nowait --passive --speed 57600"
```
Restart the GPSd service

> sudo systemctl restart gpsd

### Revert to the default setting

Although the new setting is non-persistant, you might need to revert to the default one:
> echo -e '$PMTK251,9600*17\r\n' > /dev/ttyAMA0

> sudo nano /etc/default/gpsd

Replace all the content with:
```
START_DAEMON="true"
USBAUTO="false"
DEVICES="/dev/ttyAMA0 /dev/pps0″
GPSD_OPTIONS="--nowait --passive --speed 9600"
```
Restart the GPSd service:
> sudo systemctl restart gpsd

> [!TIP]
> As a failsafe, you might power it off and remove the CR1220 battery for a few minutes.

> This is optional! Proceed with caution and at your own risk!

## Check and acknowledge the the pinout of these GPS expansions
- Ultimate GPS HAT from Adafruit: https://pinout.xyz/pinout/ultimate_gps_hat

## Check and acknowledge the logical topology of your particular SoC setup, on the PNG image generated
> sudo apt update && sudo apt install hwloc -y
>
> lstopo --logical --output-format png > \`hostname\`.png

## Improve Chrony process priority, using systemd
Due to the Chrony software has not the mechanism to reduce itself its `nice` process value, we'll force it through systemd:

> sudo sed -i '/\[Service\]/a Nice=-10' /usr/lib/systemd/system/chrony.service
>
> sudo systemctl daemon-relead
> 
> sudo systemctl restart chrony

## Disable and stop unnecessary services, reducing cpu time consumption, latency and jitter
> sudo systemctl disable --now alsa-restore.service
>
> sudo systemctl disable --now alsa-state.service
>
> sudo systemctl disable --now alsa-utils.service
>
> sudo systemctl disable --now apt-daily-upgrade.timer
>
> sudo systemctl disable --now apt-daily.timer
>
> sudo systemctl mask apt-daily-upgrade.service
>
> sudo systemctl mask apt-daily.service
>
> sudo systemctl disable --now avahi-daemon.service
>
> sudo systemctl disable --now bluetooth.service
>
> sudo systemctl disable --now bthelper@.service
>
> sudo systemctl disable --now triggerhappy.service
>
> sudo systemctl disable --now rpi-display-backlight.service
>
> sudo systemctl disable --now systemd-timesyncd.service
>
> sudo systemctl disable --now wpa_supplicant.service
>
> sudo systemctl disable --now x11-common.service

## Allocate the strictly minimum RAM from GPU to the OS system, as running headless
Add this to your `/boot/config.txt` file under the `[ALL]`section:

```
# Allocates the base minimum gpu memory, as running headless
gpu_mem=16mb
``` 

## De-activates sound, aiming less resources and latency expected, as running headless
Add this to your `/boot/config.txt` file under the `[ALL]`section:

```
# De-activates sound, aiming less resources, fewer latency and interferance expected, for a headless server
dtparam=audio=off
```

## Set the correct SDCard clock only if using UHS-I cards - RPI 3B+ only
Check for markings about `UHS-I`, `I`, `U1` or `U3`. If they exist, go ahead **(at your own risk)**.

Add this to your `/boot/config.txt` file under the `[pi3+]`section:

```
[pi3+]
## Set the SDcard clock on 100 MHz, for UHS-I specs if appropriate.
dtparam=sd_overclock=100
```

## Auto-restart 10 seconds after a Kernel panic
The Raspberry Pi OS does not have this setting, useful in extreme cases, forcing a full system restart.

> echo "kernel.panic = 10" | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/90-kernelpanic-reboot.conf >/dev/null


## Remove the uneeded support for 2G/3G/4G/5G modems

> sudo apt remove --purge modemmanager -y
> 
> sudo apt autoremove --purge -y

## Disable the support for Swap
> sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt

Add this ```noswap```, after this ```rootfstype=ext4```, and save.

## Disable sdcard swapping for improving its lifespan and reducing unnecessary I/O latency
> sudo dphys-swapfile swapoff
>
> sudo dphys-swapfile uninstall
>
> sudo update-rc.d dphys-swapfile remove
>
> sudo reboot

That's all! :-)
