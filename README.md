# Raspberry PI 3B+ NTP Server - Stratum 1
A straightforward approach to achieve a cost-effective (~100€) Stratum 1 NTP server, coordinated with highly precise PPS (Pulse Per Second) sourced from the GPS radio service plus NTP public servers across the internet to get the absolute time reference.

Can be prepared to be used with *off-the-grid* applications such as IoT in remote locations/air-gapped systems or WAN connected IoT ones (as presented here).

The end result with a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and an Adafruit Ultimate GPS HAT MTK3339:

![The Server Fully Assembled](./img/rpi_fully_assembled.jpg)

This is my recipe for Raspberry PI OS `Bullseye`, kernel 5.10.103-v7+.

## Achievements @ December 2022:
- [X] ns local clock timekeeping (std dev < 200 ns on PPS source)
- [X] µs timekeeping across multiple networks (std dev < 100 µs)
- [X] stable operation with low frequency value (usually < 10 ppm)
- [X] serve time to more than 160 clients (capable of many more)
- [X] optimize the MK3339 for NMEA timming only
- [X] increase the serial baudrate to its maximum (up to 57600 bps)
- [ ] correct the timekeeping skew from ambient temperature flutuation
- [ ] replace the fake RPI RTC with a DS3231 high precision one.

# Setup the server

## Upgrade your system and install the required software
> sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
> 
> sudo apt install gpsd gpsd-tools gpsd-clients pps-tools chrony setserial -y


## Disable the serial TTY (linux console) on the UART interface
> sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service
> 
> sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service
> 
> sudo systemctl disable hciuart

## Disable the kernel support for the serial TTY
> sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt

remove this ```console=serial0,115200``` sequence only and save.


## Configure the Raspberry PI

Add this to your '/boot/config.txt' file

```
# Uses the /dev/ttyAMA0 UART GPS instead of Bluetooth
dtoverlay=miniuart-bt

# Disables Bluetooth for better accuracy and lower interferance - optional
dtoverlay=disable-bt

# Disables Wifi for better accuracy and lower interferance - optional
dtoverlay=disable-wifi

# Configures the GPS with PPS gpio support
dtoverlay=pps-gpio,gpiopin=4

# Disables kernel power saving
nohz=off

# Disables Energy Efficient Ethernet - improves jitter and lag (~200us)
dtparam=eee=off

# Force CPU high speed clock
force_turbo=1
```

## Remove the support to receive NTP servers through DHCP
> sudo rm /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/ntp
> 
> sudo rm /lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks/50-ntp.conf
> 
> sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf

Remove the references for `dhcp6.sntp-servers` and `ntp-servers`

## Decrease the serial latency for improved accuracy and stability
> sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/gps.rules

Add the content:

```
KERNEL=="ttyAMA0", RUN+="/bin/setserial /dev/ttyAMA0 low_latency"
```

## Force the CPU governor from boot, being always 'performance', aiming better timekeeping resolution
> sudo nano /etc/init.d/raspi-config

Replace all the content with:
```
#!/bin/sh

Wait for 15 minutes, allowing the system clock to converge into a proper offset range, around sub milisecond.

# Advanced Adafruit MK3339 chip tuning

> __Warning__ This is optional! Proceed with caution and at your own risk!

## Set NMEA sentences for timming only

Change the NMEA settings, sending exclusivly the timing one (`$GPRMC`), reducing the jitter on the `GPS` `refclock`:

Stop the gpsd service:
> sudo service gpsd stop

Set the instruction:

```echo -e '$PMTK314,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0*29\r\n' > /dev/ttyAMA0```

Restart the gpsd service:
> sudo service gpsd start

### Revert to the default setting

Although the new setting is non-persistant, you might need to revert to the default one:
> echo -e '$PMTK314,-1*04\r\n' > /dev/ttyAMA0

As a failsafe, you might power it off and remove the CR1220 battery for a few minutes.

## Set the MK3339 baudrate to its maximum

This reduces even further the NMEA sentences processing latency, by increasing the transmission speed.

Stop the gpsd service:
> sudo service gpsd stop

Set the baudrate to 57600 bps:
> echo -e '$PMTK251,57600*2C\r\n' > /dev/ttyAMA0

### Setup the GPSd daemon
> sudo nano /etc/default/gpsd

Replace all the content with:
```
START_DAEMON=”true”
USBAUTO=”false”
DEVICES=”/dev/ttyAMA0 /dev/pps0″
GPSD_OPTIONS=”-n -s 57600”
```
Restart the GPSd service:

> sudo systemctl restart gpsd

### Revert to the default setting

Although the new setting is non-persistant, you might need to revert to the default one:
> echo -e '$PMTK251,9600*17\r\n' > /dev/ttyAMA0

As a failsafe, you might power it off and remove the CR1220 battery for a few minutes.
